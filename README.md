Windows Form Application (still in progress)

Simple app which simulates smart solution for orders in restaurants.
Allows two types of logins: admin login and guest login.
Final app should be connected with a database which should store all orders (active and inactive), so reading from db and writing into db should be enabled.
For app of this kind Visual Studio 2019 is used.
This app development is still in progress :)
